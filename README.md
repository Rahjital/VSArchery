# Bullseye
A Vintage Story mod aiming to overhaul and rebalance ranged weapons in a vanilla-friendly way.

* A new aiming system, relying on player input rather than randomness
* A specific role and handling for each bow
* Obsidian and bamboo arrows, iron and steel spears, spear head clay molds
* Broad rebalance - higher damage for spears and arrows, decreased arrow break chance, spear durability higher in melee and lower when throwing, and more
* Other minor features (throw your spears with a running start to make them go farther!)

For a more information on the changes, [you can check out the project's wiki](https://github.com/Rahjital/VSBullseye/wiki).

All feedback is greatly appreciated and helps improve the mod. Let me know in an issue or in [the Vintage Story forums thread!](https://www.vintagestory.at/forums/topic/5537-archery-vanilla-friendly-ranged-weapon-overhaul/)
