# Archery
A Vintage Story mod aiming to overhaul and rebalance ranged weapons in a vanilla-friendly way.

* A completely new, more engaging aiming system
* A specific role and handling for each bow
* Iron and steel spears, casting spearheads from molten metal
* Comprehensive rebalance to make each weapon relevant without dominating
* Throw your spears with a running start to make them go farther!

For a more information on the changes, [you can check out the project's wiki](https://github.com/Rahjital/VSArchery/wiki).

All feedback is greatly appreciated and helps improve the mod. Let me know in an issue or in [the Vintage Story forums thread!](https://github.com/Rahjital/VSArchery#SorryNothingHereYet)
