GOALS

- Cooldown 
--- spears and arrows can't be shot for a moment 
--- shown visually by lowering the spear/bow for a moment; might 
--- represents the time it takes to grab a new spear/arrow

- Warmup
--- will be necessary for loaded weapons like crossbows, muskets, etc.
--- a smaller warmup could be useful even for weapons like 

- Spear rebalance
--- increase durability, but make throws reduce 2-3 durability; should make spears a more universal weapon than the ranged-with-option-of-melee
--- diminishing returns on throw damage with better materials; make copper do far more damage than flint, but very little improvement past bronze
--- allows iron and steel spears

- Bow rebalance
--- types of bows
----- Simple Bow - basic bow, easy to aim, but relatively short range (slower arrows than vanilla for higher arc)
----- Crude Bow - just like Simple Bow, but less accurate (random spread) and durable
----- Longbow - long range bow; fast (higher drag) arrows for flatter trajectory, harder to handle but very accurate; represents flight archery
----- Recurve bow - high-damage bow; slower (lower drag) arrows with high damage, very hard to hande for non-Hunters; represents war archery
--- longer draw time + cooldown, but higher damage per arrow
--- make arrow break chance per damage, to stop higher-tier bows from being inherently more efficient
--- obsidian arrows
--- various fletching colours?
 
- Minor tasks
--- make bow aim angle respect screen FOV instead of magic numbers
--- fix aiming not to be squished on non 16:10 display ratios (16:9 is the most common!)
