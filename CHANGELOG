= 2.2.0 =

- Fixed multiplayer crash bug related to bows running out of durability
- Added server-side setting 'globalAccuracy' to control how difficult it is to aim
--- use command `/bullseye set globalAccuracy 0.8` to reduce reticle sway to 80%, and so on
- QoL: Added zeroing to bows - arrows fly slightly above the crosshair, for more intuitive point blank aiming without affecting long-range shooting
- QoL: Crosshair now changes to orange when it is possible to shoot, but accuracy is still low
- Accuracy stat calculation redone; Hunter class is now guaranteed to be exactly 30% more accurate
- Major code refactor

= 2.1.0 =
