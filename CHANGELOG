- Bows show the arrow you are shooting
- Ability to choose ammo type for bows and slings (press F to select)
- Support for shooting while mounted on an entity (horse, Vies airship, etc.)

Rebalance
- Spears have slightly higher running aim penalty
- Spears have less vertical aim sway, to make judging throw distance easier
- Spears no longer have any random spread
- Slightly reduced aim sway for simple and crude bows
- Increased longbow damage bonus to +60%
- Increased longbow movement accuracy penalty to 130%
- Reduced recurve bow damage bonus to +35%, but made it charge slightly faster (still has the best sustained damage of all bows)
- Reduced recurve bow movement accuracy penalty to 50%
- Reduced aim sway of recurve bow
- Can no longer sprint when aiming a bow
- Walking when aiming is now slower (slowest with longbow, fastest with recurve bow)
